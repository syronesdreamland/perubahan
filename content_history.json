The Dancing Plague of 1518, where hundreds of people mysteriously danced to their deaths in the streets of Strasbourg, France, with no explanation or end to the hysteria.

Angel Falls in Venezuela has a climb so steep that water doesn't flow down, it gets blown away into mist by the wind. One blind man has climbed the Seven Summits, including Mount Everest, and completed the journey in under 6 months. Climbers on Mount Denali, formerly known as Mount McKinley, experience such extreme cold their feces freeze before hitting the ground.",

The highest mountain climbed by a person with a disability is Mount Everest by Mark Inglis, a double amputee. The first person to climb all 14 eight-thousanders was Reinhold Messner in 1983. The youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, the highest mountains on each continent, was Jordan Romero at age 13. The fastest ascent of Mount Everest was done in 8 hours and 10 minutes by Nirmal Purja, a Nepali climber.",

The Radium Girls, female factory workers who painted glow-in-the-dark watch faces with radioactive paint, were told to moisten their brushes with their tongues, exposing them to lethal doses of radium. The Unit 731 experiment in Japan during WWII involved horrific human experimentation, including vivisections and germ warfare tests on prisoners. The Dancing Plague of 1518 in Strasbourg, France, began with one woman dancing uncontrollably in the streets, leading to hundreds of others joining her, resulting in dozens of deaths from exhaustion and heart attacks.",

The Radium Girls, female factory workers who painted glow-in-the-dark watch faces, were told to wet their brushes with their tongues, ingesting radioactive material daily. This practice led to severe health issues, including radiation poisoning and disfigurement. The unit 731 experiment in Japan during WWII saw prisoners subjected to inhumane tests, including vivisections and biological warfare experiments. The Danvers State Hospital in Massachusetts was built on a hill where accused witches were executed, and later became notorious for its inhumane patient treatments and brutal lobotomies. The forced assimilation of Native American children in boarding schools led to cultural erasure, physical abuse, and trauma that still affects communities today."

It all started when I picked up a set in a high school electronics class, thinking it was just a bunch of junk. But as I fiddled with it, I realized I actually had a knack for it. Next thing you know, I'm sneaking into friends' houses and practicing on old lockers. I even snuck into my family's vacation cabin one summer and managed to pick the safe in just minutes. I was in way over my head, but something about it was addictively thrilling. I'm not proud of it now, but there's this secret thrill you get from knowing a combination or bypassing a lock that's been puzzling you.\""

We're talking thousands of Indians dancing around idols, covered in glittering dust and oil - it was absolute madness. As I wove through the crowd, someone grabbed my wrist and yanked me into a secret room beneath the main tent. Next thing I know, I'm being forced-fed a shot of something strong by some shady-looking guru. Then... nothing. When I came to, I was outside, my head throbbing, my wallet gone."

I've got a system, you see \u2013 I've calculated that if I just 'accidentally' leave my desk for one hour at 2 PM, exactly, I can make it to the poker table by 3, and that's when the real magic happens. The science behind it? Our brains are wired to crave immediate gratification, and when we're bored at work, we seek that rush anywhere.
